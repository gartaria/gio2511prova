    <h3 class="text"> <b>Abstract:</b> The idea for this book is to give the basics needed to bring a user inside the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.
      You will find the foundamental concepts of the blockchain and the crypto world, explained in an simple way, close to the world of memes; there are some theoretical slides that are overlaid by images, screenshots, insights, illustrations, links, qr code, which invite the reader to look for information, even outside the paper.
      During the writing of the book I reported some of my thoughts about the blockchain and its world, where every day something changes, some news come out and turn all your ideas upside down.</h3>

  <h3 class="intxtext"> <b>2) The problem:</b> </h3>

  <h3 class="text"> The blockchain world is already more than extremely well established in today’s society, but as with all new technology, it brings with it a major problem. While it is a topic that can attract interest from anyone because of its versatility, there are few situations where people have really informed themselves and studied the technology before they start talking about it. It is very easy to find people who have invested in, or are trading cryptocurrencies, rather than people who have read and understood the bitcoin whitepaper, and basically that is not wrong as a thing, since with their high volatility people are very much attracted to this world more for the speculation than for the technology. This book aims to get you thinking about technology, starting with the cornerstones, and without getting into the technical. With these tools, you will get an overview of the blockchain world, and be able to study and deepen your knowledge on your own.

  </h3>


  <h3 class="intxtext"> <b>3) The solution:</b> </h3>

  <h3 class="text"> Get your own idea of the subject, try not to think about speculation and focus on the potential that this technology can offer, and is already offering the world. If while studying, or while reading this book you feel confused or can’t connect certain concepts the only solution is to give yourself time, try to go ahead and study anyway and they will probably work themselves out while reading.
      <br><br>
    Get ready for the future, good ride.
